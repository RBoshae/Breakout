Introduction
Breakout is a two-dimensional game that was influenced by Pong. The top of the screen consists of layers of bricks. A ball is bounced off a paddle, controlled by the player, and used to destroy bricks upon contact. When a brick is destroyed  or the ball touches a wall the ball bounces away. The player loses a turn then the ball touches the bottom of the screen and does not make contact with the paddle. Otherwise the ball continues to bounce from the paddle.
